To build this project, just use to run make with the makefile I've include to compile all of the c files. 

The file that demonstrates the DFAs, NFAs, and NFA to DFA translator is auto.c. After running make, just run auto.exe and it will prompt for I/O for each of the examples in each catagory.

**IMPORTANT**
I ran out of time and could not fully optimize the NFA to DFA translator. The run time is horrendeous for the washington NFA to DFA. I have this test I/O promt commented out for this reason. It does work...but it will take around 7min-10mins to finish building the DFA from the NFA. Sorry about this.
